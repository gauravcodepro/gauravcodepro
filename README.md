Hallo My name is Gaurav Sablok 
==============================

Academic Staff Member, Universitat Potsdam, Germany. Research Interest: Bioinformatics | ¬†Deep Learning | DataAnalytics | DevOps | Generative AI | Knoweldge Graphs
---------------------

Highly communicative, task oriented, feature responsive, time oriented, approachable, solution seeker and initiative taker focussed professional working across a wide variety of topics which includes bioinformatics involving genomes, transcriptomes, metagenomes and metatranscriptomes focussing on datasets coming from the plant, bacterial and fungal genome (Illumina Miseq, NextSeq, NovaSeq, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore). My interest and expertise also dwells across data analytics, machine and deep learning and devops. I have taken initiatives and established computing clusters and also specific blades in my previous positions. I am skilled in both pbs and slurm based high performance computing clusters, devops management and uses git, docker, kubernetes, terraform for container orchestration. I program across Python, R, Shell, NuShell, Hashicorp, Ruby, Awk, Shiny, Streamlit, Ruby on Rail, Django. Skills present below will start from the os,devops,programming, machine learning and code deployment. When I am not writing code, I am reading and learning new code. If you are interested in developing your work culture and ethics then you can read my working ethics for making your work culture and surroundings stronger. By implementing this you will only become stronger and not weaker. You can read it here and at the same time, kindly add so that I can broaden my working style and develop my mindset further as I believe in taking constructive approaches.
