I work across a wide variety of topics which includes bioinformatics involving genomes, transcriptomes, metagenomes and metatranscriptomes focussing on datasets coming from the plant, bacterial and fungal genome (Illumina Miseq, NextSeq, NovaSeq, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore). My interest and expertise also dwells across data science, machine and deep learning and devops. I work on the analysis of the genomics and the transcriptomics. I have taken initiatives and established computing cluster and also specific blades in my previous positions. I am skilled in both pbs and slurm based high performance computing clusters, devops management and uses git, docker and kubernetes for container orchestration.
