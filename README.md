I am a highly motivated and skilled personnel actively work across Bioinformatics, Data Science and Analytics, Machine and Deep Learning. My areas of focus are Bioinformatics, DataScience and Analytics, Machine and Deep Learning. I use Python, R,  Shell, Nu, Ruby, Awk, Crystal, Groovy for Jenkins and Ansible. I also use rust based nushell programming for many aspects from data exploration to datascience and bioinformatics. I work with large scale sequencing (transcriptomics, genome sequencing metagenomics) involving the assembly of the large plant genomes from high order to lower order, chloroplast genomes, bacterial genomes, metagenomics and fungal genomes using a wide variety of sequencing technologies such as Illumina Seq, MiSeq, NextSeq, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore. 

I have extensive experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological mining of large-scale data-sets and databases, which can elucidate the genetics and genomics in plant, bacterial and fungal species. In addition, I do genome analysis and comparative genomics in plant, bacterial and fungal genomes. I apply my knowledge and skills in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological data mining, which can be used to understand the biological basis. 

I work across high performance computing and skilled in both pbs and slurm computing clusters and use git, docker for containerization and jenkins, ansible and kubernetes for container orchestration. If you would like to connect then you can connect with me below:
