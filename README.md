Research Interest: Bioinformatics,  DataScience, Machine and Deep Learning, DevOps. I read about what i code. 
I work across a wide variety of topics which includes bioinformatics, data science, machine and deep learning and devops. I work on the analysis of the genomics and the transcriptomics datasets from the plant, bacterial and fungal genomes. I specializes in analyzing the illumina (Miseq, NextSeq, NovaSeq) and long read sequencing such as the PacBio or the Oxford Nanopore sequencing. I also work on the analysis of the metagenomes and the meta-transcriptomes. I apply data science approaches, machine learning approaches to learn from the data. I have established independent computing cluster and also specific blades in my previous positions. I am skilled in both pbs and slurm based high performance computing clusters, devops management and uses git, docker and kubernetes for container orchestration. I program across Python, R,  Shell, NuShell, Hashicorp, Ruby, Awk, Crystal. Shiny interface for python and R. Shell and NuShell for datascience, bioinformatics and high performance clusters. Ruby for DevOps plus other programming objects and classes. Getting along with Ruby on Rails and Crystal and Django in Python for front end development.
