**About me**

- **Open to collaboration and position on Bioinformatics, Deep Learning, Language Deep models,and DevOPs.**
- **Candidate word: If i have applied for your open position then i am surely interested**
- **Read this:** [Immediate joining and relocation](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/work.md), [Past collaborator and employers](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/approach.md), [Mentality Note](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/mentality.md), [Professionalism](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/personality.md)
- Application package: [Covering Letter](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/covering_letter.pdf), [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/Curriculum_Vitae_Gaurav_Sablok_2024_7_10.pdf), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36633064300), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4157-9405), [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/C-5940-2014). [Employers references](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/references.pdf).
- Approachable at [gauravcodepro@gmail.com](mailto:gauravcodepro@gmail.com)
- All code and ideas concieved and written by me unless specified.
- Voracious reader of language model implementations [language-models](https://paperswithcode.com/)
- **Continous learning, and latest feature addition in the priority languages and areas of interest**
- **Prior to 2022, all the code I wrote was internally hosted by the research institutions/universities.** 

[**Work Attitude**](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/mentality.md) and [**Professionalism**](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/personality.md)
- **Decisions and approaches/attempts not made in time have no value and importance.**. I read scientific aptitude to increase my work potential for continous development. Active in solving limitations and applicative person, proficient in developing new approaches for code development. I belive in effectively working with those, who talk to me and not other way around. I belive in not taking and appreciating indirect approaches as it never generate results. Extremely collaborative and open to supporting those who support me. I give importance and priority to the people I am working with. I pick the programming langauge to get the work done and can drop anytime and pick another.

**Communication skill**
- **If someone understands without speaking/listening it is a sign of disordered personality and supporting/enterntaining or getting involved is your loss.**. **You are allowed to believe/assume anything and that has nothing to do with me if you have not listened from me.** I think very precisely before speaking as what has spoken cant be fetched back. Communicative, approachable, motivated, task and solution oriented, time responsive, and initiative taker. Pro-active in making effective communication as communication leads to result oriented approaches.
