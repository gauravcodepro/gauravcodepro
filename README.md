I am a highly motivated and skilled personnel actively work across Bioinformatics, Data Science and Analytics, Machine and Deep Learning. My areas of focus are Bioinformatics, DataScience and Analytics, Machine and Deep Learning. I use Python, R, Shell, Nu, Ruby, Awk, Crystal. I am coding both in R and Python shiny application. I also use rust based nushell programming for many aspects from data exploration to datascience and bioinformatics. I work with large scale sequencing (transcriptomics, genome sequencing metagenomics and single cell genomics(plants specific) and also spatial transcriptomics) involving the assembly of the plant genomes from high order to lower order, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, bacterial genomes, metagenomics and fungal genomes coming from Illumina Seq, MiSeq, NextSeq, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore. 

I have extensive experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological mining of large-scale data-sets and databases in plant, bacterial and fungal species. In addition, I do genome analysis and comparative genomics in plant, bacterial and fungal genomes. I apply my knowledge and skills in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological data mining, which can be used to understand the biological basis. 

I work across high performance computing and skilled in both pbs and slurm computing clusters and use git, docker and kubernetes for container orchestration. If you would like to connect then you can connect with me below
