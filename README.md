### Hallo ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Gaurav Sablok and i work as Academic Staff Member, Universitat Potsdam, Germany. Research Interest: Bioinformatics |  Deep Learning | DataScience | DevOps

I read about what i code and have been coding in several programming languages and i am a fanatic reader about the same. I like reading the data structures and also working on writing the new code. I dont code in C anymore but when needed still write a bit of it. I work across a wide variety of topics which includes bioinformatics, data science, machine and deep learning and devops. I work on the analysis of the genomics and the transcriptomics datasets from the plant, bacterial and fungal genomes. I specializes in analyzing the illumina (Miseq, NextSeq, NovaSeq) and long read sequencing such as the PacBio or the Oxford Nanopore sequencing. I also work on the analysis of the metagenomes and the meta-transcriptomes. I apply data science approaches, machine learning approaches to learn from the data. I have established independent computing cluster and also specific blades in my previous positions. I am skilled in both pbs and slurm based high performance computing clusters, devops management and uses git, docker and kubernetes for container orchestration. I program across Python, R, Shell, NuShell, Hashicorp, Ruby, Awk, Crystal. Shiny interface for python and R. Shell and NuShell for datascience, bioinformatics and high performance clusters. Ruby for DevOps plus other programming objects and classes. Ruby on Rails,Crystal and Django for front end development.

*   🌍  I'm based at Universitat Potsdam Germany
