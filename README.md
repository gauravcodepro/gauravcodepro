Talks about #devops, #datascience, #datanalytics, #bioinformatics, and #dataengineering

I am a highly motivated and skilled personnel actively involved in  Plant Bioinformatics | Illumina | PacBio | OxfordNanoPore | Transcriptomics | Genomics | Metagenomics | DevOPS | Data Engineering and Analyst | Python | R | Java | Scala | Bash | HTML | CSS | DJANGO and i work across bioinformatics, data science, engineering and analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing including devops. I have worked with large scale sequencing involving the assembly of the large genomes, chloroplast genomes, bacterial genomes and fungal genomes using a wide variety of genomic technologies such as Illumina Seq, MiSeq, NextSeq, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore. I am involved in all facets of plant research, including genetics, bioinformatics. I have extensive experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological mining of large-scale datasets and databases, which can elucidate the genetics and genomics in the crop, model, and non-model plant species. In addition, I do genome analysis and comparative genomics in bacterial and fungal genomes and model and non-model plant species. I believe in the application of the computational application of the genomics pipelines to generate results that can help understand better biology. I donâ€™t believe in reinventing the wheel, I believe in a solution-based approach to generate results. I have a wealth of knowledge in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological data mining that can be used to understand the genetics and genomics of crop, model, and non-model plant species. Additionally, I conduct comparative genomics and genome analysis on bacterial, fungal, and model and non-model plant species. I support the use of computational applications of the genomics pipelines to provide findings that can improve biological understanding. I believe in using a solution-based approach to produce results rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Apart from research, I am a focused certified fitness professional and lifestyle coach. My current lines of research and focus are: Plant Bioinformatics | Illumina | PacBio | OxfordNanoPore | Transcriptomics | Genomics | Metagenomics | DevOPS | Data Engineering and Analyst | Python | Java | Scala | Bash | HTML | CSS | DJANGO
