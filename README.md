ðŸ‘‰ **About me** 
- Open to position on **Plant, Bacterial, Fungal Bioinformatics, Deep Learning including language models,and DevOPs**.
- If i have applied for your open position then i am surely interested as you apply where you are interested and areas of interest.
- If i have previously applied to your position and not been selected and still open then let me know.
- Prior to 2022, all the code I wrote was internally hosted by the research institutions/universities.

ðŸ‘‰ **Work Attitude/Professionalism**
- Extremely collaborative and open to supporting those who support me.
- Even AI prompt says ask me something then i will tell, so asking is the first way to initiate a open ended discussion/building relation. This shows that even silence or observance doesnt even work in AI, which is ahead of human thinking as per science.
- Highly Communicative, approachable, motivated, task and solution oriented, time responsive, and initiative taker.
- I believe decisions and communication not made in time have no value and importance.
- I give importance and priority to the people I am working and communicating with.
- I fork repositories as per language and dependencies need and once learnt then unforked.
