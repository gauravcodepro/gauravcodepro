### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Gaurav Sablok
#### This is my Github account![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19677953/198241251-8f8a9514-d4a1-4710-8df8-71ec318b30a2.jpg)

My research is focused on Sequencing and Bioinformatics and the field of first preference plants, bacterial, and fungal genomics, and interested in new domains. I work in all aspects of plant science from sequencing to bioinformatics, genomics and bioinformatics workflows, and analytical pipelines. In the case of bacterial and fungal-only genome assembly and bioinformatics. Currently, I am also learning data science to merge these emerging fields and build a strong foundation. I am open to all new ventures.
I am trained as a plant biologist and as a bioinformatician and have extensive experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological mining of large-scale datasets to mine the functional information, which can elucidate the genetics and genomics in the crop, model, and non-model plant species. In addition, I do genome analysis and comparative genomics in bacterial and fungal genomes and model and non-model plant species. 
I believe in the application of the computational application of the genomics pipelines to generate results that can help understand better biology. I donâ€™t believe in reinventing the wheel, I believe in a solution-based approach to generate results. 
My research till now has been focused on the bioinformatics application of the high throughput sequencing and approaches to understand the functional and biological significance of the genes, evolution, and pathways in plants, bacterial and fungal genomes. 

My current lines of research and focus are: 
1. Plant, bacterial and fungal genomics and bioinformatics
2. Data Science and Analytics 
3. Cyber Ethical Hacking
4. Business Analytics
