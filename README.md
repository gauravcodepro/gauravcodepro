### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Gaurav Sablok
#### This is my Github account![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19677953/198241251-8f8a9514-d4a1-4710-8df8-71ec318b30a2.jpg)

A little introduction about me and what are my areas of expertise and what i am adding to my cart of expertise. My research is focused on Sequencing and Bioinformatics and prefer plants, bacterial, and fungal genomics, and interested in new domains. I work in all aspects of plant science from sequencing to bioinformatics, genomics and bioinformatics, and development of analytical pipelines. In the case of bacterial and fungal-only genome assembly and bioinformatics. Currently, i am also focussing on Data science, Devops, Business Analytics, Ethical Hacking to merge these emerging fields and build a strong foundation. I am open to all new ventures.

I have extensive experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological mining of large-scale datasets, which can elucidate the genetics and genomics in the crop, model, and non-model plant species. In addition, I do genome analysis and comparative genomics in bacterial and fungal genomes and model and non-model plant species. I believe in the application of the computational application of the genomics pipelines to generate results that can help understand better biology. I donâ€™t believe in reinventing the wheel, I believe in a solution-based approach to generate results. 

My current lines of research and focus are: 
1. Plant, bacterial and fungal genomics and bioinformatics
2. Data Science and Analytics 
3. Cyber Ethical Hacking and Lean Operation Management

Apart from research, I am a focussed certified fitness professional and lifestyle coach.
