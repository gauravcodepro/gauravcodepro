### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Gaurav Sablok
#### This is my Github account![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19677953/198241251-8f8a9514-d4a1-4710-8df8-71ec318b30a2.jpg)

Fact about me: When i am not interested, i am not interested and when i am interested, you don't have to think twice about my integrity. Read below my interest in subjects below and the areas i work in and do research. I am looking forward to join hands for progressive growth. I go offline while coding, focussing and reading. My interest and research is focused on  Bioinformatics, Data science Engineering and Analytics, DevOPS. Sequencing and Bioinformatics and prefer plants, bacterial, and fungal genomics, and interested in new domains. I work in all aspects of plant science from sequencing to bioinformatics, genomics and bioinformatics, and development of analytical pipelines. In the case of bacterial and fungal-only genome assembly and bioinformatics. I have extensive experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological mining of large-scale datasets, which can elucidate the genetics and genomics in the crop, model, and non-model plant species. In addition, I do genome analysis and comparative genomics in bacterial and fungal genomes and model and non-model plant species. I believe in the application of the computational application of the genomics pipelines to generate results that can help understand better biology. I donâ€™t believe in reinventing the wheel, I believe in a solution-based approach to generate results. 

My current lines of research and focus are: 
1. Plant, bacterial and fungal genomics and bioinformatics
2. Data Science, Engineering and Analytics 
3. In case of cybersecurity, i am only interested in CISSP, SOC and Penentration Testing. Nothing else. 

Apart from research, I am a focussed certified fitness professional and lifestyle coach.
