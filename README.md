 
**About me** 
- Open to collaboration and position on Bioinformatics, Deep Learning, Language Deep models,and DevOPs.
- If i have applied for your open position then i am surely interested.
- If i have previously applied to your position, and not been selected and still open then i am interested.
- Continous learning, and latest feature addition in the priority languages and areas of interest.
- Prior to 2022, all the code I wrote was internally hosted by the research institutions/universities.
- All code and ideas concieved and written by me unless specified.
- [Immediate joining and relocation](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/work.md), [Past collaborator and employers](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/approach.md), [Mentality Note](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/mentality.md), [Professionalism](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/personality.md).
- Application package: [Covering Letter](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/covering_letter.pdf), [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/Curriculum_Vitae_Gaurav_Sablok_2024_7_10.pdf), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36633064300), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4157-9405), [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/C-5940-2014). [Employers references](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/references.pdf).
- Approachable at [gauravcodepro@gmail.com](mailto:gauravcodepro@gmail.com)
- Voracious reader of language model implementations [language-models](https://paperswithcode.com/)

[**Work Attitude**](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/mentality.md) and [**Professionalism**](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/personality.md) 
- Decisions and communication not made in time have no value and importance.
- I constantly read scientific aptitude/literature/code development to increase my work potential.
- I belive if you dont read new development, you will never be able to diversify and apply.
- Active in solving limitations and applicative person, proficient in developing new approaches for code development.
- Extremely collaborative and open to supporting those who support me.
- I give importance and priority to the people I am working with.
- I pick the programming langauge to get the work done and can drop anytime and pick another.
- I fork repositories as per language and dependencies need and once learnt then unforked.
- I never take part in bringing any other person down as i believe by taking part in such is already a sign that you are below that person. 

[**Communication skill**: Clear, presice, applicative](https://github.com/gauravcodepro/gauravcodepro/blob/main/approach.md)
-  Communicative, approachable, motivated, task and solution oriented, time responsive, and initiative taker.
-  Pro-active in making effective communication as communication leads to result oriented approaches.
- If someone understands without speaking/listening it is a sign of disordered personality and supporting/enterntaining/getting involved/giving importance is your loss.
- Loss is yours: You are allowed to believed/thought/assume/judged/linked/talked anything and that has nothing to do with me if you have not listened/confirmed from me. 
- If you are a past collaborator or anyone and havent talked/met/contact in last years, please kindly dont write to me.
