Talks about #devops, #datascience, #datanalytics, #bioinformatics, and #dataengineering

I'm a person who always thinks before speaking. Speak the truth. Speak up front. Consider your options in advance. Be a growing individual rather than a perfectionist, as perfection can never be attained. When I'm not interested, I'm not interested, and when I'm interested, you don't have to question my integrity. Read about my areas of interest, where I work, and where I conduct research, below. While reading, focusing, and programming, I disconnect from the internet. Bioinformatics, Data science, Engineering and Analytics, and DevOPS are the main topics of my research and interest. Sequencing and bioinformatics are used, along with a preference for plant, bacterial, and fungal genomes, as well as an interest in new fields. I am involved in all facets of plant research, including genetics, bioinformatics, and the creation of analytical tools.

I have extensive experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological mining of large-scale datasets, which can elucidate the genetics and genomics in the crop, model, and non-model plant species. In addition, I do genome analysis and comparative genomics in bacterial and fungal genomes and model and non-model plant species. I believe in the application of the computational application of the genomics pipelines to generate results that can help understand better biology.

I have a wealth of knowledge in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biological data mining that can be used to understand the genetics and genomics of crop, model, and non-model plant species. Additionally, I conduct comparative genomics and genome analysis on bacterial, fungal, and model and non-model plant species. I support the use of computational applications of the genomics pipelines to provide findings that can improve biological understanding. I believe in using a solution-based approach to produce results rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Apart from research, I am a focussed certified fitness professional and lifestyle coach.
