#### A one page description on my work approach, mentality, professionalism, collaboration, associations.

#### Association: 
- I have no association with any person at the personal, family level, so kindly dont approach or benefit anyone on my behalf.
- I have no family member, no father, mother, brother, sister or anyone, so available for immediate relocation.
- I dont associate myself to any number/colour. If you have thought of or have been told then you are highly mistaken.
- I dont like or believe someone that i havent met or seen. You cant self-imagine.
- I dont take part in interactions that are simply discussing other people.
- I dont believe words about someone such as their preferences, likes, dislikes, where they want to work or anything else without asking them as that might lead to wrong decisions.
- If you have associated any numbers or letters or anything to personal perferences then it is your lookout, i have nothing to do with the same as without knowing no one can understand.
- I distance myself from those, who are taking a lot about others without others even knowing or others speaking about them, as it means that they have nothing to talk about them.
- If someone says to me that he or she thinks about this, i make a approach to ask that is it true or just a mere assumption of someone as this can significantly destroy my relations.
- I am not associated with any number, colour, browser, operating system, so i dont believe in this crap.
- I am not applying to your position to find someone.
- If you a past collaborator or anyone and i havent seen you ever and talked to you or been in contact with you in the last few years, please dont write to me.
- If you are a past employer that i havent approached/made contact except for references, then please kindly dont approach me.
- If you are anyone from the PhD place prior to me joining or after me till now, kindly dont contact or write me. I have no space and time.


#### Application 
- I am extensively applying and submitting applications and ready to take the first selected position.
- I am available immediately and i will give importance to the person, who approaches me directly and immediately.
- I respect everyone and i thank you and i am available for immediate joining.
- I thank you for employing me and i assure you that I give my complete dedication. 
- I am applying to your position becasue i am interested in working there.
- I have a work strong work ethic and I respect people those who appreciate that.
- If you have any questions, then please feel free to ask me rather than asking anyone else.

#### Means of Communication
- This will save you time, as i belive that you are yourself an important person and like everyone have limited time.
- Instead of me writing through a reply that please invest your time effectively in yourself or not even replying. For some, not having a reply means a good thing and for me, having a no reply means not interested as that is what straight and clear person talks. So if you dont have a reply from me means not interested and dont write me further. 
- Read these points and self evaluate yourself. This will tell you your importance. 
   - Since how long i havent been in contact with you. 
   - Since last when i saw you / talked to you personally.
   - Since last when i replied to your email.
   - Do you know me directly or through any other person.
   - If you know me through other person, did you attempted to talk to me directly.
   - If you know me indirectly, ask since how long i have been in contact with that person or how well enough that person knows me. 
   - Your outcome will be what you believe without talking to me and that has nothing to do with me.
- If answer to any of these questions is inconsistent or not applicable then kindly dont contact. This will save your self confidence that you wrote and never heard back. 
- I appreciate you investing your time in yourself and giving yourself the credit, importance you deserve to yourself.
- I give importance to those who are clear, approachable, and not assumptive and judgemental as i cant work on assumptions. I have the ability on work not to evaluate someone assumptions.
- if you have given importance to someone else thinking that i am attached or something else and discarded me then you are highly mistaken and kindly dont approach me.
- I give importance to those who are clear, approachable, can talk and not assumptive and judgemental as i cant work on assumptions. I have the ability to work on real not to evaluate or take part in someone assumptions.
- Thank you for reading and self evaluating this.

#### Mentality
- If you have any questions, take the liberty to ask the candidate itself as he or she is going to work for you and not his parents, family, or anything else. So give the prime importance to the candidate.
- If you are affected by directions such as right or left then ask yourself, that how can a person be mentallity right when he or she is talking about this: look that person is looking at 10.00 am in the right direction, so he is a right person and the same person at 10.02 am (just after 2 minutes) looking in the left direction, so he became bad. So if you work is less important then you can listen to such endless talks of mentally ill person and give less importance to your work or you can totally avoid them and give importance to the candidate. When you start ignoring them, after some time, they will stop even saying as they know it that you have stopped listening and you have realized who is right and wrong and who is actually worth of giving importance.
- I cant understand people without speaking or talking to them and neither i am interested in those people.
- Inspect visually that how productive the candidate is and his performance both at the professional level and before and after leaving employers. You should also compare the employer performance when the candidate was with them and before and after them and you will be able to make better decisions.
- What a candidate is reading and developing and if he or she is developing that for your work, then you should give importance to the candidate rather than from where he or she is downloading and anything else. That is not important as that is momentary and what the candidate applies to your work is long lasting and goes as output and not from where it is downloaded. You should appreciate that the candidate is learning and developing the same for your work rather than sitting idly and wasting time.
- I use the tools such as github, browser, code editor, terminal client, linux management and others written by others like everyone and if you have objection with colour,icon,appearance or if you have interpreted anything else then please kindly report to those organization as this has nothing to do with me. I have not developed them. They should be able to answer these questions. They should be able to change the colour, icon, whatever you want for your needs. I use them to develop myself and apply to my work, so i dont have interest in any specific colour, icon or any other interpretation coming from those.
