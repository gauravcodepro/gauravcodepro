- **Effective means of communications as outlined to build new communications/development to increase your value, and time**:
- This will save you time, as i belive that you are yourself an important person and like everyone have limited time.
- Instead of me writing through a reply that please invest your time effectively in yourself or not even replying. For some, not having a reply means a good thing and for me, having a no reply means not interested as that is what straight and clear person talks. So if you dont have a reply from me means not interested and dont write me further. 
- Read these points and self evaluate yourself. This will tell you your importance. 
   - Since how long i havent been in contact with you. 
   - Since last when i saw you / talked to you personally.
   - Since last when i replied to your email.
   - Do you know me directly or through any other person.
   - If you know me through other person, did you attempted to talk to me directly.
   - If you know me indirectly, ask since how long i have been in contact with that person or how well enough that person knows me. 
   - Your outcome will be what you believe without talking to me and that has nothing to do with me.
- If answer to any of these questions is inconsistent or not applicable then kindly dont contact. This will save your self confidence that you wrote and never heard back. 
- I appreciate you investing your time in yourself and giving yourself the credit, importance you deserve to yourself.
- **If you are a past collaborator and i havent seen you ever or talked to you or been in contact with you in the last few years, please dont write to me, I am not interested and will not reply.**.
- **If you are a past employer that i havent approached/made contact except for references, then please kindly dont approach me, i will not reply**
- **This should be self-understandable that i am not approaching you and neither i follow or search about your research, so you should do the same. You will listen the same what is mentioned here, either no reply or a blunt reply: please dont write me further**
- If you think that I am issing or remembering someone, you are highly mistaken.
- If you have believed this by listening to someone and treated me accordingly, you will not have a second chance.
- I give importance to those who are clear, approachable, and not assumptive and judgemental as i cant work on assumptions. I have the ability on work not to evaluate someone assumptions. 
- Thank you for reading and self evaluating this.
