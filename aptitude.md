**Getting to know your candidate ahead**: A one page description on my work approach, mentality, professionalism, collaboration, associations. You will not find a single deviation from this in my approach and i hate speaking lies, so i speak what is there and work on what is approachable and has existence and i dont waste time on imagination/assumption. I am laying down these points so that you dont have to listen, consider anyone thoughts and you have the freedom to make a proper decision as you have the entire liberty after reading this to ask me directly anything. This allows to build a strong work attitude with the prospective employer, which allows to put emphasis on time, timely work and a proper healthy working environment as he knows the candidate way of working, approach, mentality ahead.

- **This account will be closed and all the code will be shifted to the new code repository after join the position**.
- Following these rules and approaches allowed me to add additional new programming languages which are top listed in addition to the previous ones.  I dropped coding in C and C++ since 2021, added multitude of new abilities, while applying for positions during the carrier advancement, as my way of approach and thinking is very clear, straight and applicative.
- Not a over thinker, not observe everything, gives value to the person, with whom I am talking and gives importance to the ones with whom i have a talk.
- Never mirror a person or look for one person into another as you cant superimpose a person or anything from one onto another.
- I dont talk double meaning and double thoughts, i believe in if it is there or if it is not there. I dont address someone, and talk about someone else.
- I dont give importance to those, who only speaks as you cant show anything by simply talking, you can have endless thoughts, assumptions, words on anyone but are they true?, ask the corresponding person and if not then it means, you have wasted your time by associating with such people.
- I dont dwelve into people personal choices such as which browser you use, which code editor, font, theme or operating system, or any other non-living thing as that is not important to me. My work and project goals are achieved that is important. No one cares, what code editor you use or what browser you use and those who cares about these are not scientific people. I dont spend time on whatever non-living thing you use as that has no meaning and after sometime, you throw them in trash or discard them so any decision made on such aspects is a sign of mental illness.
- I dont believe in those who say wait and see, as they are already showing that they are time wasters and today they are wasting yours, tomorrow someone else. Instead, i believe in those, grab the oppurtunity, work on the same and generate results as that will give prominecense and visibility.
- I stay away from the assumptive people or mere assumption as if you belive those people, then they will say the results will come tomorrow, then another tomorrow and it goes on but actually it will never comes and you cant destroy someone time and life for years, as it is fake and you cant have anything from fake people and fake assumptions. So i invest my time in what is actually there , result oriented and time oriented and dedicate my concentration on the same. This makes me applicative and result-oriented and not a fake person, who belives everything and thinks about everything.
- I believe: If anyone have benefited any other person, or thought that i am attached to the same, anyone, think about anyone, follow their path, follow their advice, you are highly mistaken and wrongly informed. Loss is yours if you have benefited or believed someone based on false information without even talking to the concerned person. Make a better attempt of asking that person everything.
- I am not someone personal property, so anyone saying that i belong to them at any personal, work related is fake. I stay away from such people as they lack the mental aptitude and claiming their rights without even knowing the person and spreading false fake words.
- If someone says i like someone or anything, it is all fake words and no attachment to anyone. If someone says then you are allowed to write a common email to both and ask me directly, actually the moment you will say, you will see them running away and you will automatically know who is true and who is false. This is to prevent any noise coming to the employer as employer knows the candidate is honest and clear enough and i can ask anything.
- Like a normal person, i read a lot of code across several web platform and i dont keep a track of where it is coming from and who is there. Like people read mine and i dont know who reads and neither invest my time in that, i read others also and new structures to learn better and apply better in the position.
- You can take this a reference note about the person ability and investment and upgradation and value addition to myself. 

### Application
- I am applying contiously and ready to take the first selected position and I am available immediately
- Everyone needs one position for themselves and ready to take the position in which i am selected and make space for other candidates in the other position.
- I respect everyone and i thank you and i am available for immediate joining.
- I thank you for employing me and i assure you that I give my complete dedication. 
- I am applying to your position becasue i am interested with you. 
- I have a work strong work ethic and I respect people those who appreciate that.
- If you have any questions, then please feel free to ask me rather than asking anyone else.
- I read the programming languages extensively, which i code and add continously to the same as without knowing the language you are just as copy and paste command runner and you dont know the inner abouts of the same. I dont copy and paste command runner, so i read extensively, code them and develop better approaches as it can be needed anytime, and i dont believe in digging well, when i am thirsty. I plan much ahead my work.

### Employer Benefits
- If someone understands without speaking/listening it is a sign of disordered personality and supporting/enterntaining/getting involved/giving importance is your loss.
- If someone thinks/assumes that the other person is understanding without saying to him or her then it is wasting their time and others time and it will never give a result. Putting your energy and efforts in something, which doesnt yield a result is a garbage.
- I never take part in bringing any other person down as i believe by taking part in such is already a sign that you are below that person, so you can imagine by supporting them what you will get/achieve.
- Loss is yours: You are allowed to believed/thought/assume/judged/linked/talked anything and that has nothing to do with me if you have not listened/confirmed from me. 
- A consious employer, will ask directly to the employee that i want to hear from you whether this is there/true or not before (while hiring) and also after employment.
- A unconsious employer, believes everything without asking employee and an employee loss.
- If anyone is saying to you that we will hire and you should not, then you are making a loss to your institution/university and not me as my role is submission of application and that i did with the consistency and also developed myself with the integrity for the same. It is upto you to belive them or not as when not shown means it doesnt exist.
- I give importance to those people, who can come in front and speak as that will tell what is there. I dont give importance to those people, who cant come in front and only speak from behind as that already shows that they have a fugitive mentality. You cant trust those people who dont have the courage to come in front and speak as those who cant speak in front are usally telling lies. By trusting such people and taking wrong decisions, you are actually making loss to yourself and others.
- I stay away from those people, who are taking salary from the place of the work but are putting their attention and intervention into other people life, work and everything else. This already proves that the person lacks an integral part of the work attitude, so should not be trusted.
- I belive in those people, who say that let me ask the candidate and the person directly, if you are right then you shouldnt be afraid and if you are stopping me to ask the candidate or the person directly then it means you are taking approaches to delimit someone life and carrier, which itelf shows that you are not on the right person to listen. 
- As a prospective employer, i request you to ask to avoid intervention, these questions to someone who intervened: 1. Is this project funded by you?. 2. Are you a part of this project or organization/ funding this project/salary or anything?. 3. Why should i give importance?. 4. Should i let the candidate know that there is someone intervening, so that it should be discussed on both sides otherwise it is a one-sided talk and who knows it is true or not?. Usually people start to disappear away, when such questions are asked as nothing bring more shame then facing the truth if you are speaking lies.
- Inspect visually that how productive the candidate is and his performance both at the professional level and before and after leaving employers. Please also compare the employer performance when the candidate was with them and before and after them and you will be able to make better decisions.
- This will help you develop better relations with the candidate and trust and strength build on such clear, goes a long way.
- As a candidate my role is to submit all the applications i can submit and as a prospective employer, your role is to grab the candidate. Matters like place of work, where candidate to work should be left with the candiddate decision as this is enritely the candidate decision. It should not be guessed, forced, assumed or listened from anyone except the candidate. This will build such a strong bond with the candidate that you have listened to the person, who will be doing the work and not to anyone else.

### Association/Think: 
- I have no association with any person at the personal, family level, so kindly dont approach or benefit anyone on my behalf. If anyone has said, ask me promptly. 
- I have no family member, no father, mother, brother, sister or anyone, so available for immediate relocation.
- I dont associate myself to any number/colour. If you have thought of or have been told then you are highly mistaken.
- I dont like or believe someone that i havent met or seen. Self imagination and assumption is a disease.
- I dont take part in interactions that are simply discussing other people.
- I dont believe words about someone such as their preferences, likes, dislikes, where they want to work or anything else without asking them as that might lead to wrong decisions.
- If you have associated any numbers or letters or anything to personal perferences then it is your lookout, i have nothing to do with the same as without knowing no one can understand.
- I distance myself from those, who are taking a lot about others without others even knowing or others speaking about them, as it means that they have nothing to talk about them.
- If someone says to me that he or she thinks about this, i make a approach to ask that is it true or just a mere assumption of someone as this can significantly destroy my relations.
- I am not associated with any number, colour, browser, operating system, so i dont believe in this crap.
- I am not applying to your position to find someone.
- If you are anyone prior to PhD or during PhD or after that till now, kindly dont contact or write me. I have no space and time. Additionally, i dont even remember your faces.
- If you a past collaborator or anyone and i havent seen you ever and talked to you or been in contact with you in the last few years, please dont write to me.
- If you are a past employer that i havent approached/made contact except for references, then please kindly dont approach me.
- I stay away from people, who without even talking become friend in their own mind by watching someone and then become enemy based on their own thinking without talking. So this means that neither they existed and nor they have importance.
- I am a very approachable and talkative person, who understands only when it is said like a normal person. If it is not said means it doesnt exist and if someone has said that i understand without talking, you have been falsified and wrongly informed. You will find that it was worthless to even talk and listen to those people.

### Means of Communication
- This will save you time, as i belive that you are yourself an important person and like everyone have limited time.
- Instead of me writing through a reply that please invest your time effectively in yourself or not even replying. For some, not having a reply means a good thing and for me, having a no reply means not interested as that is what straight and clear person talks. So if you dont have a reply from me means not interested and dont write me further. 
- Read these points and self evaluate yourself. This will tell you your importance. 
   - Since how long i havent been in contact with you. 
   - Since last when i saw you / talked to you personally.
   - Since last when i replied to your email.
   - Do you know me directly or through any other person.
   - If you know me through other person, did you attempted to talk to me directly.
   - If you know me indirectly, ask since how long i have been in contact with that person or how well enough that person knows me. 
   - Your outcome will be what you believe without talking to me and that has nothing to do with me.
- If answer to any of these questions is inconsistent or not applicable then kindly dont contact. This will save your self confidence that you wrote and never heard back. 
- I appreciate you investing your time in yourself and giving yourself the credit, importance you deserve to yourself.
- I give importance to those who are clear, approachable, and not assumptive and judgemental as i cant work on assumptions. I have the ability on work not to evaluate someone assumptions.
- if you have given importance to someone else thinking that i am attached or something else and discarded me then you are highly mistaken and kindly dont approach me.
- I give importance to those who are clear, approachable, can talk and not assumptive and judgemental as i cant work on assumptions. I have the ability to work on real not to evaluate or take part in someone assumptions.
- Thank you for reading and self evaluating this.

### Mentality
- If you have any questions, kindly take the liberty to ask the candidate itself as he or she is going to work for you and not his parents, family, or anything else. So give the prime importance to the candidate.
- I am not associated with any direction, colour or anything and if that has been told then it is a falsified information that has been established. Ask yourself, that how can a person be mentallity right when he or she is talking about this: look that person is looking at 10.00 am in the right direction, so he is a right person and the same person at 10.02 am looking in the left direction, so he became bad, so basically signs of mental illlness.
- I cant understand people without speaking or talking to them and neither i am interested in those people as either you born dumb or you born with a tongue, so if it is there, use it. 
- What a candidate is reading and developing and if he or she is developing that for the work, then kindly give appreciation, support and importance to the candidate rather than from where he or she is downloading and anything else. Many websites ask before downloading that click on the images to prove that you are human and i dont know how to download without clicking, so that clicking images is not a matter of evaluation as it is momentary. I appreciate those, who appreciate that the candidate is learning and developing the same for the work rather than sitting idly and wasting time.
- I use the tools such as github, browser, code editor, terminal client, linux management and others written by others like everyone and if you have objection with colour,icon,appearance or if you have interpreted anything else then please kindly report to those organization as this has nothing to do with me. I have not developed them. They should be able to answer these questions. They should be able to change the colour, icon, whatever you want for your needs. I use them to develop myself and apply to my work, so i dont have interest in any specific colour, icon or any other interpretation coming from those.
- I never trust a person, who has everything and still taking wrong approaches to slow down or bring another person down. I beleive in those, who stand others as this is what i have done till now.
- I never trust a person, who is afraid of coming in front as that already shows that personal lacks a ability to come in front and trusting such person is like trusting someone that has no face.
- **I never believe a person who has resources and instead of making the use of resources still companining that the other person is doing well because he os she has that, it is simply a liar, who is good in making excuses and using others.**
