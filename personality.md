#### Effective approaches I apply for personality, clear approach and healthy environment. 

- I dont associate myself to any number/colour. If you have thought of or have been told then you are highly mistaken.
- I dont like or believe someone that i havent met or seen. You cant self-imagine.
- I dont take part in interactions that are simply discussing other people.
- I dont believe words about someone such as their preferences, likes, dislikes or anything without asking them. Believing someone about someone else is like believeing the superimposed choices.
- If you have associated any numbers or letters or anything to personal perferences then it is your lookout, i have nothing to do with the same as without knowing no one can understand.
- I distance myself from those, who are taking a lot about others without others even knowing or others speaking about them, as it means that they have nothing to talk about them.
- If someone says to me that he or she thinks about this, i make a approach to ask that is it true or just a mere assumption of someone as this can significantly destroy my relations.
