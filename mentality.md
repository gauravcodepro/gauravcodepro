#### I strongly request you to read this and consider this:

<p align = "justify">

- If you are a person, who is more interested in talking to the other as compared to the person doing the work, such as the candidate appearing for the position itself, then you should hire those others. I believe that the person, who is hired can only olve your problem.
- If you have any questions, take the liberty to ask the candidate itself as he or she is going to work for you and not his parents, family, or anything else. So give the prime importance to the candidate.
- **If you are affected by directions such as right or left then ask yourself, that how can a person be mentallity right when he or she is talking about this: look that person is looking at 10.00 am in the right direction, so he is a right person and 10.02 am(just after 2 minutes) looking in the left direction, so he became bad. So if you work is less important then you can listen to endless talks of such mentally ill person and give less importance to your work or you can totally avoid them and give importance to the candidate. When you start ignoring them, after some time, they will stop even saying as they know it that you have stopped listening.**
- First give importance to your work as your work will be done by the candiate and not by others, if you loose the candidate and hire some loose candidate then its your loss.
- Inspect visually that how productive the candidate is and his performance both at the professional level and before and after leaving employers. You should also compare the employer performance when the candidate was with them and after them and before them and you will be able to make better decisions.
- What a candidate is reading and developing and if he or she is developing that for your work, then you should give importance to the candidate rather than from where he or she is downloading and anything else. That is not important as that is momemtary and what the candidate applies to your work is long lasting. You should appreciate that the candidate is learning and developing the same for your work rather than sitting idly and wasting time.
